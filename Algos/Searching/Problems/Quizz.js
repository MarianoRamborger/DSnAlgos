//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
//Breadth first search, starts searching the closest to the parent

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
//Oddly Breadth first search, cause DFS would take a long time, and since the tree is deep, it may repeat
// over and over and over. BFS may take a lot of memory though tho, so DFS could also be an option.

//If the tree is very wide:
//DFS, because Breadth first search would take too much memory.

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
//Depth first search

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
//Depth first search

//Finding the shortest path:
//Breadth first search
